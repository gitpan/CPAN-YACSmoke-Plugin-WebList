SYNOPSIS
      my $plugin = CPAN::YACSmoke::Plugin::WebList->new(%config);
      my @list = $plugin->download_list();

REQUIREMENTS
    This package requires the following modules (most of which are not
    included with Perl):

      CPAN::YACSmoke
      WWW::Mechanize
      Template::Extract

Installation
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL method.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is intended to be used as a plugin extension with
	CPAN::YACSmoke. Its use standalone, is not terribly useful, as such
	see CPAN::YACSmoke for more useful information.

CAVEATS
    This is a proto-type release. Use with caution and supervision.

    The current version has a very primitive interface and limited
    functionality. Future versions may have a lot of options.

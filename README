NAME
    CPAN::YACSmoke::Plugin::WebList - WebList plugin for CPAN::YACSmoke

SYNOPSIS
      my $plugin = CPAN::YACSmoke::Plugin::WebList->new(%config);
      my @list = $plugin->download_list();

REQUIREMENTS
    This package requires the following modules (most of which are not
    included with Perl):

      CPAN::YACSmoke
      WWW::Mechanize
      Template::Extract

Installation
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL method.

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use nmake instead.)

DESCRIPTION
    This module is intended to be used as a plugin extension with
	CPAN::YACSmoke. Its use standalone, is not terribly useful, as such
	see CPAN::YACSmoke for more useful information.

CAVEATS
    This is a proto-type release. Use with caution and supervision.

    The current version has a very primitive interface and limited
    functionality. Future versions may have a lot of options.
